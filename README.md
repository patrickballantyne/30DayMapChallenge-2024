## 2024 - Day 29: Overture

Using POI data from Overture, I looked at the geography of deli's in the UK. This arises from my constant frustration that there aren't enough places in cities and towns where you can get a fresh sandwich made at lunchtime. Sorry UK but Ireland does a much better job of this!

The R code to produce this map can be found [here](code.R).
